Installerade nyss en ny macbook och hittade en bra Gitbook som stÃ¶d. 

>This book covers the basics of setting up a development environment on a new MacBook for most major languages. All instructions covered have been tested on Mountain Lion and Mavericks, but they might be more inclined towards Mavericks. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone to use as a reference when installing some languages/libraries.
